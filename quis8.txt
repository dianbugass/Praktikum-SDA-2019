                True (*)
                False

4.            All systems must include functionality to provide logging or journaling in conceptual data models. True or False?   Mark for Review

                True

5.            You are doing a data model for a computer sales company where the price fluctuates on a regular basis. If you want to allow the company to modify the price and keep track of the changes, what is the best way to model this?      Mark for Review

                A. Create a product entity and a related price entity with start and end dates, and then let the users enter the new price whenever required.
                B. Create a new item and a new price every day.
                C. Use a price entity with a start and end date
                D. Allow them to delete the item and enter a new one.
                E. Both A and C (*)

6.            Which of the following is a logical constraint that could result from considering how time impacts an example of data storage?               Mark for Review
(1) Points
                End Date must be before the Start Date.
                EMPLOYEE periods can overlap causing the database to crash.
                An ASSIGNMENT may only refer to an EMPLOYEE with a valid employee record at the Start Date of the ASSIGNMENT. (*)
                Dates must be stored with Time.

7.            Formal rules exist for drawing ERD's. You must always follow them, even if it results in an ERD that is difficult to read. True or False?   Mark for Review
(1) Points
                True
                False (*)

8.            In an ERD, High Volume Entities usually have very few relationships to other entities. True or False?        Mark for Review
(1) Points
                True
                False (*)

9.            In an ERD, it is a good idea to group your entities according to the expected volumes. By grouping high volume entities together, the diagrams could become easier to read. True or False?       Mark for Review
(1) Points
                True (*)
                False

10.          No formal rules exist for drawing ERD's. The most important thing is to make sure that all entities, attributes, and relationships are documented on the diagram, and the diagram is clear and readable. True or False?              Mark for Review
(1) Points
                True (*)
                False

11.          How do you know when to use the different types of time in your design?          Mark for Review
(1) Points

                You would first determine the existence of the concept of time and map it against the Greenwich Mean Time.
                Always model time; you can take it out later if it is not needed.
                The rules are fixed and should be followed.
                It depends on the functional needs of the system . (*)

12.          All systems must have an entity called WEEK with a holiday attribute so that you know when to give employees a holiday. True or False?        Mark for Review
(1) Points
                True
                False (*)

13.          When a relationship may or may not be transferable, depending on time, this is know as a/an:  Mark for Review

14.          Which of the following would be a logical constraint when modeling time for a country entity?   Mark for Review
(1) Points
                Daily traffic patterns must be monitored to determine which countries are overcrowded.
                Countries may change their names and/or borders over a period of time. (*)
                People have births and deaths in their countries that must be tracked by the system.
                If you are doing a system for France or Germany, you would need security clearance.

15.          Which of the following would be a logical constraint when modeling time for a City entity?           Mark for Review
(1) Points

                Cites may change their names and/or country association if the borders of a country change. (*)

                Daily traffic patterns must be monitored to determine how many law enforcement officers are needed.

                People are born in the city and people die in the city.


                If you are doing a system for any French City, you would need security clearance.
